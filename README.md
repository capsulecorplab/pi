# Description

Pharo Install - A tool for installing Pharo Smalltalk packages.

PI is a MIT-pip-like library for Pharo Smalltalk.

# Features

  - Listing supports only SmalltalkHub for now. 
  - Installs (only) Metacello Configurations from Catalog (command line handler: get) or SmalltalkHub (command line handler: config)
  - It works with curl or wget

# Usage notes

  - The "install" option defaults to the current Pharo "stable" version. 
  - PI can query SmalltalkHub or GitHub. 
  - PI can install packages from SmalltalkHub (working on GitHub repositories).
  - Package search is case-sensitive.
  - For GitHub repositories: 
  - - If it has "pharo" as topic, then it will be listed.
  - - If jq is not available, it will be downloaded to the directory where pi was executed.
  - For SmalltalkHub repositories: 
  - - Requires libxml2 (xmllint command).
